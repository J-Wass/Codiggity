## What it is
First place overall and best media hack of Hack BU Spring 2016. Using the rhyme brain API and our own sentence structuring, Codiggity generates fully fledged rap songs with a single click, along with a backbeat and voice synthesis. Ignore the sketchy code, we had less than 24 hours to finish this ;)

## Future of Codiggity
<ul>
<li>Better grammar parsing</li>
<li>Only use words related to previous words</li>
<li>More customization</li>
</ul>
